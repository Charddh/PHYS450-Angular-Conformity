#Author: John Stott Lancaster University
#This is a quick python tutorial for performing simple data tasks for astrophysics. It is designed to help MPhys students.
#This is for Python 3.x I recommend using Anaconda download of Python (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) as this keeps a version of python that is separate to any others you may already have installed on your computer (this can avoid an issue if you have a mac - as messing with the preloaded version of python can upset your operating system).
#I run python code with iPython using a text editor to edit my code but you may prefer an IDE instead as they are probably more user friendly. An IDE is just a window that contains a window for the code text editor and a window for the python output, plus usually a way of keeping track of your variables. I'd avoid Jupyter notebooks though as they require too much interaction and can cause problems with the order in which things are run etc.

#1. preamble
#the purpose of the lines below is to load various modules into python to improve functionality for data analysis as the standard python is quite basic


#the 2 lines below clear all variables in ipython every time you run the code. This is not needed if you are not using ipython and will cause your code to fail so I have commented them out
#from IPython import get_ipython
#get_ipython().run_line_magic('reset','-sf')


import numpy as np #this is a module that has array functionality 


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #graph plotting module


from astropy.io import ascii #astropy is an astronomy module but here we are just importing its data read in functionality. If astropy not included in your installation you can see how to get it here https://www.astropy.org/


from astropy.table import Table, Column, MaskedColumn# this is astropy's way to make a data table, for reading out data


from astropy.cosmology import FlatLambdaCDM# this is the cosmology module from astropy


import glob #allows you to read the names of files in folders 


from scipy.optimize import curve_fit #allows you to fit your own user defined curves to data


from sys import exit #allows you to put an exit() to stop your code in a certain place, good for debugging or only running part of a script


#you can also write your own modules and place them in the PYTHONPATH for use in all of your scripts


########################
#2. Basics


#variable names: python variable names are case sensitive so be careful a is not the same as A


#Types of data:
#Python complains if you get your data types mixed up so you need to be careful. The 3 most common types you will come across are integers, floats and strings


a=10 #integer
b=10.0 #float - can also just write b=10.  
c='ten'#string


print('a=',a,'b=',b,'c=',c)


#type tells you what type a variable is (works for arrays too). A more extreme version of this is "a?" which gives full details
print('type(a)',type(a),'type(b)',type(b),'type(c)',type(c))


#multiplying integers and floats
print('a*a=',a*a,'b*b=',b*b,'a*b',a*b)


#Maths operators are: plus +, minus -, multiply * and divide /
#raise to the power is ** square root is np.sqrt()
print('raise to power and square root')
print('b**2.0=',b**2.0,'np.sqrt(b)=',np.sqrt(b))




#exit() #uncomment this to stop the code here


#Arrays:
#python without any modules imported works with lists which are inferior to arrays and so try and do everything in numpy arrays. NB lists don't have the mathemtical operations that arrays have i.e. you can't multiply lists by a number and get the more logical answer you get with np.arrays and you can't multiply lists together  
#Python also uses Tuples - e.g. the output of np.where. Tuple vs list: List has mutable nature i.e., list can be changed or modified after its creation according to needs whereas tuple has immutable nature i.e., tuple canâ€™t be changed or modified after its creation.




#to make an array a
a=np.array([4,5,6,7,8])


print('this is array a',a)


b=[1,2,3,4,5]#this is a list
print('this is list b',b)


#turn list b into an array
b=np.array(b)#now its a list


print('turn it into an array b=np.array(b)',b)


#length of an array
print('length of array b, len(b)',len(b))




#to index an array (i.e. select 1 or more elements of the array) remembering python starts counting at element 0


print('a=',a)
print('a[0]=',a[0],' python starts counting at element 0')
print('a[2]=',a[2])
print('a[-1]=',a[-1],'as [-1] is the last element of any array')


#to slice an array i.e. just look at some parts of it
print('a[0:2]=',a[0:2],' Note: The result includes the start index, but excludes the end index. Unlike IDL!')




#change array type


print(a)
print('array dtype',a.dtype)
print('change to float with np.astype')
a=a.astype('float64')#float64 as np float is 64 bit
print(a)
print('array dtype',a.dtype)


#make an array of consecutive numbers
b=np.arange(20)#20 element array with integers from 0-19. Can obviously change this to a float etc with astype
print('20 element array with values from 0-19')
print(b)


#make an empty array
#if you want to make an empty into which you will inset values
a=np.empty(10,dtype=int)#creates an array with 10 elements (you can also specify the dtype, default is float I think), however in certain cases this array is created containing values and so if you aren't going to overwrite them all it may be better to use np.zeros(a) in which case each element will be set to zero  
print('created an empty array of 10 elements',a)
a=np.zeros(10,dtype=int)
print('created an empty array of 10 elements all set to zero',a)


#arrays can also contain many dimensions i.e. a 3x2 array is created by:
a=np.empty((2,3),dtype=int)
print('created a 3x2 array',a)
print('note that array was not truly empty and so use np.zeros instead')
a=np.zeros((2,3),dtype=int)
print(a)


#array multiplication
print('array multiplication (or division)')
a=np.array([1.,2.,3.,4.,5.])
b=np.array([2.,1.,2.,1,2.])


print('a=',a)
print('b=',b)


print('a*2.',a*2.)


print('a*b',a*b)
print('can also add+, subtract-, divide/, raise to power**, square root arrays np.sqrt() in an analogous way')


#number of decimals
#if you want to round your values (i.e. for displaying a value in the the legend of a plot) use np.round()
b=2.3456
print('unrounded',b, 'rounded to 2 decimal places',np.round(b))

#below sets up the comsology
cosmo = FlatLambdaCDM(H0=70., Om0=0.3)#H0=70 and OmegaM=0.3 are reasonable parameters to use (what I use in all of my papers) - as it's flat this means OmegaLambda=0.7
